# 🚀 RollerAudit v4.3

Professional inventory auditor for RollerCoin.

### 📝 How to use:
1. Open the [RollerAudit Website](https://midok92.github.io/Rolleraudit-test1/).
2. **Drag and Drop** the "START SCAN" button to your browser's **Bookmarks Bar**.
3. Go to any RollerCoin player's profile (Room view).
4. Click the **RollerAudit Bookmark** you just saved.
5. Wait for the magic: the script will automatically click the first rack, scan all miners, and download a `.csv` report named after the player.

### ⚠️ Requirements:
* Make sure you are logged into the game.
* Game State: You must be on a player's room page (e.g., rollercoin.com/p/username).
* Do not switch tabs while the audit is running.
* Laggy Connection: If you have a slow internet connection, the script will automatically wait for the room data to load before proceeding.
* If the "Auto-Targeting" fails to find the first rack (e.g., due to unusual screen scaling), simply click the first rack yourself to open the slot info, and then launch the bookmark.

* Export Details:
Format: The report is exported as a UTF-8 CSV file.
Compatibility: Use Google Sheets or Excel (with "Import Data from CSV" setting) to view the report correctly with all columns separated.
